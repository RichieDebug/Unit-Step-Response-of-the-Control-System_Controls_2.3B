# Unit-Step-Response-of-the-Control-System_Controls_2.3B
Consider the satellite attitude control system as shown in Figure 3a. The output of this system exhibits continued oscillations and is, therefore, not desirable. This system can be stabilized by  introducing an inner feedback loop with gain 𝐾ℎ as shown in Figure 3b. Write a MATLAB-Simulink program to obtain a unit-step  response of the control system in Figure 3b using the value 𝐾ℎ determined in part (a).  Please remember to label the axes and title the plot.
